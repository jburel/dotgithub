# OME Code of Conduct

Last updated: Feb 2021

## Preamble

OME is a community of technology developers, imaging scientists and
experimentalists dedicated towards building and using imaging data for
discovery and insight. OME uses a variety of electronic forums and media
(GitHub, Slack, Zoom, Trello, Image.sc and others) to mediate communication
among its developers and its global user community. By using OME’s Slack,
posting on OME’s GitHub repositories, participating in Zoom calls hosted by
OME, attending meetings and workshops either organised by OME or in which you
participate as an OME team member, you agree to abide by the following Code of
Conduct and the
[University of Dundee’s policies](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/equality-diversity/publications-policy/policy/)
on “Dignity at Work and Study” and “Equality and Diversity”.

## Updates to this Code of Conduct

OME reserves the right to update this code of conduct at any time. When
updates do occur (as [pull requests](https://github.com/ome/.github/pulls)
against https://github.com/ome/.github), a message will be posted to the
[image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/) to notify OME developers and users.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by OME and its
collaborators. Violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a
person's ability to participate within the OME-managed spaces.

## Expected Behavior

At OME we do not have pages of policies or procedures. Instead we have short,
guiding statements of our values and principles.

### Be Great and if possible, Awesome

Always try to do the best work you can do, for you, for OME, and for our users.

### Be Humble

Nothing is perfect. Be self-aware and always be respectful of others.

### Be Empathetic

Act with compassion and respect for colleagues and users.

### Be Adaptable

Be curious, and always be ready to change. There is always more to learn.

### Be Transparent

Be open and honest with others and most importantly, yourself. 

## Unacceptable Behavior

The University of Dundee’s [Dignity at Work and Study](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/media/dundeewebsite/equalityanddiversity/documents/Dignity%20at%20Work%20&%20Study%20Policy%20-%20June%202020.docx)
details the principles we work by, types of behaviours we won’t tolerate, and
the mechanisms we will use for addressing any issues. For emphasis, we are
relisting a few below:

### Threats of Violence

Threats of violence towards another user is not acceptable. This includes
encouraging violence towards a user(s) or posting/threatening to post other
peoples personally identifying information (known as “Doxxing”).

### Personal Attacks

There will always be times when two parties will have a difference of opinion.
While this can be frustrating, this should never turn into a personal attack
on someone. Attacking people for their opinions, personal beliefs, ideas, or
suggestions is not acceptable. Please be professional and respectful at all
times.

### Derogatory/Harmful Language and Harassment

Harmful language towards a user’s:

- Background
- Family
- Gender Identity or Expression
- Sexual Orientation
- Race/Ethnicity
- Age
- Native Language
- Abilities
- National Origin
- Location
- Religion or culture / cultural beliefs
- Political affiliation and/or views
- Other personal attributes

is not acceptable. 

## When Something Happens

If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:

-   Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to 
    stop and/or edit their message(s).
-   That person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the issue.
-   If this doesn’t happen, or if you’re uncomfortable speaking up, email
    codeofconduct@openmicroscopy.org.  If your issue is with a member of OME’s
    senior management team, contact HR-Life-Sci@dundee.ac.uk. 
-   As soon as available, an admin will join, identify themselves, and take
    further action (see below). 
-   When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots,
    context, or other information that may be used to better understand and
    resolve the situation.

We will use the established University policies and procedures to handle all
Code of Conduct violations.

## Handling Issues with External Partners

Many OME team members are employees or contractors of the University of
Dundee, and therefore bound by the University’s policies and procedures. OME
will use the same policies for addressing any issues that arise with non-OME
developers or users. OME may, according to these policies block usage, access
to its developers, or participation in OME’s community resources. These
decisions are final.

## Voice/Video Calls + Screen Sharing

Slack and Zoom provide the ability for users to use Voice/Video Calling with
the added ability to have screen sharing. Our rules for Expected and
Unacceptable Behaviour apply in these and all the communication media we use.
When using these features be mindful and respectful of others. Use good
judgement when sharing your screen and be mindful of other windows that may be
open on your computer containing sensitive or personal information. 

## OME Support Expectations

OME is a grant funded project and thus the community support it offers is
always “best effort”. OME aims to respond to all requests for information and
support on public forums within 24 working hours. While OME developers are
happy to assist where they can, please refrain from contacting OME staff on
personal emails or messaging OME employees with direct questions. If you have
a question about using OME’s work, understanding OME’s tools or directions, or
just want to connect, please use a public forum like image.sc.
